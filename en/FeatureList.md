#### <a name="AppGallery">- AppGallery</a>
App Gallery is a space to either promote your apps in an enclosed (Private) community, or share with others in an open (Public) community to earn advertising revenue. App Gallery is an opportunity for everyone to earn additional revenue and user.
 		 
- Public: Earn additional revenue by placing other developers application info.
- Private: Do not place any ads, instead use it for cross promoting own applications.

AppSteroid features user generated contents to draw more user intrest towards the App. Promotion will be done seamlessly within the user community, with user generated contents. Thus, we highly recommend developers placing Ad in AppGallery to implement AppSteroid to maximize their profit.


Currently, We provide space for advertisers to place the following Ads on public AppGallery.
 		 
- Video Ads (User generated game video or interstitial ad can be placed)
- Banner Ads (It will be placed in the community and App Gallery)
- Event Ads (Announce your game event on App Gallery)

AppGallery has a potential to double the promotion profit by "running it privately on the house App, and placeing Ads on a public AppGallery".
